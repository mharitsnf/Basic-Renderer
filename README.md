# Basic Renderer
This is a basic renderer made with web technologies based on [Tsoding's video](https://youtu.be/qjWkNZ0SXfo?si=p2TBT7b4B-rh-HLm). Added TS for type safety, but still made without any graphics API!

To run locally, just clone the repository and run `npm install`. After that, run `npm run dev`.
